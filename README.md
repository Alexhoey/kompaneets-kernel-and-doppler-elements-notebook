# kompaneets-kernel-and-doppler-elements-notebook
Mathematica notebook for calculating aberration kernel and Doppler operator elements supporting MPhys project on the Kompaneets equation derivation using the boost operator approach.

This notebook:

- Recursively generates aberration kernel elements using relations and symmetries discussed in arXiv:1403.6117.
- Generates Doppler operator elements using the boost operator - aberration kernel symmetry derived in arXiv:2505.02080.

The notebook supports the results presented in:

Alex Hoey, A boost operator apprach to the derivation of the Kompaneets equation (2025).
